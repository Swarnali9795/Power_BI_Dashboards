# Data Jobs Dashboard Using Power BI

## Introduction

When I first started exploring the data job market, I noticed how fragmented the information was. Salaries were on one site, job titles on another, and location insights buried somewhere else. For **Job Seekers, Career Changers, and Job Swappers**, this made it difficult to see the bigger picture.

Thatâ€™s what inspired me to create this dashboard. Using a *real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings* (including job titles, salaries, and locations), I built a single, intuitive interface where all this information comes together. The goal was simple: make it easier to uncover market trends, compare compensation, and navigate the ever-changing world of data jobs.

## Skills Showcased

- **Data Transformation (ETL) with  Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
- **Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Job Count`.
- **Core Charts:** Utilized **Bar**, **Line**, and **Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trend over time.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize global distribution of jobs.
- **KPI Indicators and Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, and sortable data.
- **Dashboard Design:** Designed and intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
- **Interactive Reporting:**
    - **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
    - **Buttons:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    - **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high level summary to a contextual, detailed view.
