## Introduction

The data job market is notoriously fragmented. Salaries, job titles, skill requirements, and locations are often buried across disconnected sources. For **Job Seekers, Career Changers, and Job Swappers**, this lack of cohesion makes it difficult to gain a clear, actionable view of the landscape.

That’s what inspired me to create this dashboard. Using a *real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings* (including job titles, salaries, and locations), I developed this project that enables a *single-page exploration of essential market trends and compensation information*.

## Skills Showcased

- **Data Modeling & DAX Measures:** Defined implicit measures to calculate key metrics. 
- **Visual Analytics:** Used clustered bar charts to highlight top skills in demand and highest paying job titles, enabling clear comparison across categories. Focused on readability and insight extraction through effective chart selection.
- **KPI Design:** Displayed headline statistics using card visuals to emphasize core metrics like job volume and salary benchmarks, supporting quick executive-level insights.
- **Interactive Filtering:** Implemented slicers to enable dynamic data exploration across multiple dimensions. Added a **“Clear Slicers”** button to enhance usability and reset filters with ease.
- **Dashboard Layout & UX:** Designed a clean, intuitive interface that balances analytical depth with visual clarity.

## Dashboard Overview

The enhanced edition streamlines the dashboard into a sleek, single-page design, putting the most important market insights for job seekers front and center.

This dashboard serves as a strategic command center for navigating the data job landscape. It highlights essential KPIs like **Job Count**, **Skills Per Job**, and **Median Salaries (Yearly and Hourly)**, to provide a clear snapshot of market dynamics. Users can instantly identify the **most in-demand skills** (by job percent or count) and evaluate **Compensation across different Job Titles**, all within a layout optimized for clarity, speed, and insight-driven exploration.

## Conclusion

This updated dashboard demonstrates the power of Power BI in transforming large-scale job posting data into a focused, interactive career intelligence tool. Designed for **Job Seekers**, **Career Changers**, and **Job Swappers**, the dashboard offers a single-page experience to filter, compare, and interpret key market insights, empowering users to make informed, confident decisions about their next move.
